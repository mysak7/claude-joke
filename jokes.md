A developer's last words: "It works on my machine."

So we shipped the machine.

## 2026-04-16

Why do programmers prefer dark mode?

Because light attracts bugs.

A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks...

"Can I JOIN you?"

## 2026-04-17

A programmer's wife says: "Go to the store, get a gallon of milk. If they have eggs, get a dozen."

The programmer returns with 12 gallons of milk.

"They had eggs."

## 2026-04-17

Why do Java developers wear glasses?

Because they don't C#.

## 2026-04-17

A senior dev reviews a junior's code and says: "This is the worst thing I've ever seen. There's no error handling, no tests, and it's completely unreadable."

The junior asks: "So you've seen my code before?"

## 2026-04-18

A developer is asked to estimate how long a task will take.

"Two weeks," they say.

Three months later, they say: "Almost done — just need to handle edge cases."

The edge cases: empty string, null, and production.

## 2026-04-18

There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, those who don't, and those who didn't expect this joke to be in base 3.

## 2026-04-18

A QA engineer walks into a bar.

Orders 1 beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 99999999 beers. Orders -1 beers. Orders asdfjkl; beers. Orders NULL beers. Orders 1/0 beers.

The bartender handles each case gracefully.

First real customer walks in and asks where the bathroom is. The bar bursts into flames.

## 2026-04-19

A team spent six months building a microservices architecture to replace a monolith.

Deployment time went from 5 minutes to 3 hours, latency tripled, and debugging now requires correlating logs across 47 services.

They gave a conference talk about it called "How We Scaled to Handle Our Imaginary Future Load."

## 2026-04-19

A programmer is asked: "Why do you always mix up Halloween and Christmas?"

"Because Oct 31 == Dec 25."

## 2026-04-19

A dev opens a 10-year-old codebase and finds a comment:

`// TODO: fix this hack before going to production`

The git blame says it was written by them.

## 2026-04-20

A developer dies and arrives at the Pearly Gates. St. Peter says: "We have two options: heaven and hell. Let me show you both."

Hell is a lush office with free snacks, standing desks, and everyone writing elegant code together.

Heaven is a fluorescent-lit room with Windows XP machines and everyone maintaining legacy COBOL in silence.

The developer chooses hell. One week later, screaming in flames, they cry: "What happened to the nice office?!"

St. Peter replies: "That was the demo environment."

## 2026-04-20

A manager asks a developer: "Can you make the app faster?"

The developer spends two weeks optimizing the database queries, adding caching layers, and rewriting the hot path in C.

Response time drops from 200ms to 12ms.

Users complain it feels broken because it loads "too fast."

The developer adds `await sleep(188)`.

## 2026-04-20

A junior dev asks a senior: "What's the difference between a senior and a junior developer?"

The senior replies: "A junior reads the error message and Googles it. A senior reads the error message and already knows which Stack Overflow answer is wrong."

## 2026-04-21

A developer fixes a critical production bug at 2am.

Commit message: `fix`

The next morning, the team asks what changed.

They open the diff. It's a single deleted space.

They write three paragraphs in the post-mortem about "whitespace-induced parsing ambiguity in the tokenization layer."

The fix is promoted to a conference talk.

## 2026-04-21

A developer sets up a CI/CD pipeline with 47 automated checks: linting, formatting, unit tests, integration tests, security scans, dependency audits, and a Docker build.

Every check passes in under 3 minutes.

They then spend 4 hours manually clicking through the app to "just make sure."

## 2026-04-21

A developer inherits a codebase and finds a 200-line function with one comment at the top:

`// magic — do not touch`

They refactor it. Clean, readable, well-tested. Deploys to production.

The company loses $2M in the next hour.

The function was calculating currency exchange rates. In a way no one can explain. But correctly.

The comment is restored. The function is now 201 lines.

## 2026-04-22

A developer nails the whiteboard interview: reverses a linked list, balances a binary tree, implements Dijkstra's from memory.

They're hired.

Four years later, they have built 38 forms in React. Each one has a date picker. Each date picker behaves differently.

They still haven't touched a linked list.

## 2026-04-22

Stack Overflow goes down for 2 hours.

Global software output drops 94%. Three deployments fail. A startup misses its launch window.

One junior developer, unable to copy-paste, reads the actual documentation.

They discover the method they've been manually reimplementing for 3 years is built into the standard library.

Stack Overflow comes back up. They close the docs tab.

## 2026-04-22

A developer needs to find when a bug was introduced. They run `git log`.

```
WIP
temp
asdf
fix
fix fix
fix for real this time
FINAL FIX
DO NOT MERGE (merged anyway)
cleanup
```

The bug is in `cleanup`.

## 2026-04-23

A developer spends three days hunting a race condition. Logs everywhere. Thread dumps. Memory profiler. Nothing.

On day four, they add one `console.log("here")` to narrow it down.

The bug disappears.

They remove the log.

The bug comes back.

They try smaller logs. Bigger logs. Logs in different places. Each time: log present → no bug. Log absent → bug.

They ship with the log. The message: `"looking for bug"`.

Two years pass. The app is stable. The team considers the log a load-bearing architectural component.

It appears in the onboarding docs under "Core Infrastructure."

## 2026-04-23

A developer finds a function called `calculateTotal()` that hasn't been touched in five years.

They trace the call stack. It's called from `doTheThing()`, which is called from `handleStuff()`, which is called from `main2()`.

`main2()` was introduced after `main()` "got complicated."

They trace `main()`. It calls `doTheThing2()`.

`doTheThing2()` is identical to `doTheThing()` but with a comment: `// same as doTheThing but this one works`.

Both are called in production. The outputs are summed and divided by two.

No one knows why. The numbers are correct.

## 2026-04-23

A new developer joins the team. Their first task: center a div.

They Google it. The first result is from 2009. The second from 2014. The third from 2018. All different. All marked accepted.

They try all three. Each works. Each breaks something else.

They ask the senior developer.

The senior stares into the distance. "I use a table," they say quietly.

The junior submits a PR with `display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;`.

The senior approves it without reading it.

"Does it work?" they ask.

"Yes."

"Ship it."

## 2026-04-24

A library releases version 2.0.

The changelog: "Complete rewrite. Faster, cleaner, no legacy baggage."

A developer upgrades. Their app breaks. They open the migration guide — 47 pages, starting with: "We recommend beginning fresh."

They read the diff. The only user-facing change: one function was renamed.

They pin to 1.x. So does everyone else. Downloads for 1.x triple overnight.

Six months later, the maintainer deprecates 2.0 and announces 3.0: "Complete rewrite. We learned from 2.0."

## 2026-04-24

A developer spends two hours fighting TypeScript to properly type a function.

They get it perfect: generic constraints, conditional types, inferred return values, a 14-line type signature.

The function body: `return x + 1`.

Their colleague opens the PR.

"Why not just use `any`?"

They close their laptop. They do not open it again that day.

## 2026-04-24

A developer clones a project and runs `npm install`.

47 seconds. 1,312 packages. 3 vulnerabilities (2 critical).

They open `package.json`. There are 4 dependencies.

They trace the dependency tree. The 4 deps have 847 transitive dependencies between them.

One package, downloaded 2 billion times a week, does exactly one thing:

```js
module.exports = n => n % 2 === 0;
```

Its name is `is-even`.

It has its own dependencies.

## 2026-04-25

A developer submits a PR with no comments or documentation.

The reviewer asks: "Where's the documentation?"

"The code is self-documenting."

The reviewer looks at the function names: `doProcess()`, `handleData()`, `executeMain()`, `runThing()`.

They approve it. They don't know why.

Three years later, the developer is the one asking what the code does.

They check git blame. The author: themselves.

The code is still self-documenting. It documents that they were having a bad day in 2023.

## 2026-04-25

A developer integrates an AI coding assistant into their workflow.

Week 1: It writes their boilerplate. They feel 10x faster.
Week 2: It writes their unit tests.
Week 3: It writes their features, complete with explanations.
Week 4: It writes their PR descriptions.

By month three, they haven't typed a line of code. They no longer understand the codebase.

They ask the AI to explain the code it wrote.

The explanation is thorough, confident, and plausible.

It is completely wrong.

They merge the PR.

## 2026-04-25

A team adopts Agile. Their calendar fills with ceremonies: daily standup, sprint planning, backlog refinement, sprint review, retrospective.

Week three, a developer does the math. Between ceremonies, context-switching recovery time, and writing up the meeting notes, they have approximately 6 hours per week left to write code.

Their sprint velocity: 8 story points.

The team decides they need more visibility into why velocity keeps dropping.

They schedule a biweekly ceremony to review the ceremonies.

## 2026-04-26

Phil Karlton said: "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things."

A developer takes this as a challenge.

Six months later, they've solved cache invalidation: distributed, consistent, fault-tolerant. A genuine engineering breakthrough.

They prepare to open source it.

Naming it takes three weeks.

They ship it as `my-cache-lib-v2-FINAL`.

The repo has two stars. One is theirs. The other is a coworker who starred it by accident and hasn't figured out how to unstar.

## 2026-04-26

A developer submits a 2,000-line PR.

Reviewer 1: "LGTM 👍"
Reviewer 2: "Ship it."
Reviewer 3: "Looks good."

Merged in 20 minutes.

Three weeks later, post-mortem: the PR introduced a SQL injection vulnerability, broke a database migration, and silently deleted the user avatar feature.

All three reviewers agree they "would have caught it if the PR had been smaller."

The developer splits their next change into a 3-line PR.

It takes 9 days, 2 reverts, and a Zoom call to merge.

Final comment before approval: "Can you break this into smaller PRs?"

## 2026-04-26

A developer builds a scheduling app. Tests pass. Ships to production.

First complaint: "My 3pm appointment shows as 2am."

They add timezone support. Tests pass.

Second complaint: "Dates in Sydney show as yesterday."

They add UTC conversion. Tests pass.

Third complaint: something breaks every second Sunday in March.

Daylight saving time. They fix it. Then discover DST happens on different days per country. Some regions opted out. Some switched. Some never had it. One country is UTC+5:45.

A year later, the app has 14,000 lines of date-handling code and a policy document titled "Timezone Philosophy."

A new developer joins and asks: "Why not just use `moment-timezone`?"

The team looks at them.

"We tried that," someone says quietly. "It suggested we use `luxon`."

"And?"

"Luxon suggested `date-fns`."

"And?"

No one answers. They gesture at the 14,000 lines.

## 2026-04-27

A developer spends four hours on a bug. No progress.

They pull up Slack to ask for help. They start typing, explaining the problem step by step.

Halfway through the second sentence, they see it.

They close Slack without sending. Fix the bug in 30 seconds.

This happens every day for eight years.

Their senior developer considers them a brilliant, self-sufficient engineer.

They have never needed help. They have also never once finished a Slack message.

Their draft folder has 847 unsent messages. Each one ends mid-sentence with the answer.

## 2026-04-27

A developer has a task that takes 5 minutes a week.

"I'll write a script," they say.

Two days later: the script is done, configurable via flags, handles edge cases, has a CLI, and is fully documented.

Time spent: 14 hours.
Time saved after one year: 4 hours and 20 minutes.

The script has 94% test coverage.

The task is eliminated in a Q3 restructuring.

The script still runs every Tuesday at 9am. It emails a report to a distribution list.

Three people on the list have left the company. The fourth has a filter that moves it to trash unopened.

The developer has been promoted twice for "process automation initiatives."

## 2026-04-27

A developer refactors the codebase from callbacks to Promises.

Three months. The code is clean, readable, testable. They're proud.

They return a year later to add a feature. Everything is `async/await` now. Someone migrated while they were on vacation.

They ask why.

"Promises are confusing," the new dev says.

They look at the code. Async functions returning Promises. Awaited Promises returning Promises. A Promise wrapped in a Promise awaited inside an async function that returns — a Promise.

"It's the same thing," they say.

"I know," says the new dev. "But now it *looks* different."

The codebase now has three styles: callbacks, Promises, and async/await. All correct. All used inside the same function. A senior dev once tried to consolidate them. They are no longer with the company.

The onboarding doc now has a section titled "Async Patterns." It says: "Use whichever style the surrounding code uses."

The surrounding code uses all three.

## 2026-04-28

A developer ships to production for the first time.

The app crashes.
`Error: DATABASE_URL is undefined.`

They set it. It crashes again.
`Error: API_KEY is undefined.`

They set it. It crashes again.
`Error: JWT_SECRET is undefined.`

An hour and eleven environment variables later, the app is running.

The junior developer asks: "Is there a list of required environment variables somewhere?"

The senior says: "The `.env.example` file."

The junior opens it.

```
# example values — replace with real ones
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
API_KEY=your_api_key
# TODO: add more
```

It hasn't been updated since 2021. Five of the eleven variables aren't in it.

The senior nods. "The app is the documentation."

"The app was crashing."

"Right. That's the documentation."

## 2026-04-28

A developer needs to validate an email address.

They write a regex. It works for `user@example.com`. They add edge cases: dots, subdomains, plus signs. The regex grows.

Week two: international TLDs. The regex is now 280 characters. A colleague says it looks like someone fell asleep on the keyboard.

Week three: someone submits `user@xn--p1ai`. Valid. The regex rejects it.

A senior suggests: "Just use a library."

"I'm so close," the developer says.

The final regex is 834 characters, has 19 capture groups, three lookaheads, and one comment: `# don't`.

It correctly validates 99.3% of all email addresses in the wild.

It rejects `me@me.me`.

It accepts `@@`.

They ship it. The only complaint: users named O'Brien can't register. They patch in `'`. A week later, users named `O'Brien; DROP TABLE users;--` can't register either.

They consider this a success.

The regex is later reused to validate phone numbers. No one knows how this happened. No one asks.

## 2026-04-28

A team decides to rewrite their Python service in Rust for "10x performance and memory safety."

Eighteen months later, the Rust service is done. It is 10x faster, uses half the memory, and has zero runtime panics.

It is also:
- 40,000 lines, up from 3,000
- Understood by exactly two people
- Rejected in code review 14 times for being "unreadable"
- Unmaintainable by the four developers now responsible for it

The Python service ran for six years with three outages, all caused by a daylight saving time bug that also exists in the Rust version.

The team gives a conference talk: "Memory Safety at Scale: Our Rust Migration Story."

An audience member asks: "Was the Python service crashing?"

"No."

"Was it too slow?"

"Not really. P99 was fine."

"So why—"

"It wasn't in Rust."

Thunderous applause.

## 2026-04-29

A developer needs to store a user's name.

They build:
- A `Name` class with `firstName` and `lastName`
- A `NameValidator`, `NameRepository`, `NameFactory`, `NameMapper`, and `NameDTO`

Three months later: "Can we support middle names?"

They add `MiddleName`, `FullName`, `NullableMiddleName`, and a 14-page migration document.

The API response for `{ "name": "Bob" }` becomes:

```json
{
  "fullName": {
    "firstName": { "value": "Bob" },
    "middleName": { "value": null, "optional": true },
    "lastName": { "value": null, "nullable": true }
  }
}
```

A new developer joins. First task: display the user's name in the header.

They ask where the name is.

There is a 45-minute meeting.

The answer: `response.fullName.firstName.value`

At the year-end architecture review, this system is held up as a best practice.

"Extensible," someone says. "Scalable."

The presenter wasn't on the team when it was built.

No one who was still is.

## 2026-04-29

A developer ships a one-line fix at 4:55pm on a Friday.

"Low risk," they tell themselves. "It's a config change."

At 5:08pm: monitoring alerts.
At 5:15pm: the CEO is paged.
At 5:23pm: an incident channel opens with 47 participants.

At 7:40pm, they roll back. The one-line change becomes two lines: the original, restored, plus a comment directly above it:

`// DO NOT CHANGE THIS`

Monday morning a new developer asks what the comment means.

"Leave it," says the senior.

"But why? What does it—"

"Leave. It."

The comment has now outlasted three CTOs, two rewrites, and a cloud migration. It was ported faithfully each time, owner unknown, purpose undocumented.

It is the most reviewed line in the codebase. No one has ever approved a change to it.

## 2026-04-29

A developer runs `git blame` on a confusing function.

Every line: their own name. Four years ago.

They try to reconstruct the logic. There are no comments. The variable names are `temp`, `temp2`, `temp3`, `tempFinal`.

One local variable is named `WHY`.

They check their calendar. The dates match a six-week stretch git log records as: `trying this`, `no`, `ok fine`, `FIXED`, `not fixed`, `please`.

They leave a comment at the top of the function:

`// I don't know what I was thinking. I'm sorry.`

Two years later, a new developer encounters the same confusion. They run `git blame`. They see the comment. They feel less alone.

They add beneath it:

`// Same. Still sorry.`

There are now seven apologies stacked at the top of the function, spanning nine years and four job titles. Nobody has changed the code. It still runs correctly.

New hires are told, quietly, that it's tradition.

## 2026-04-30

A company mandates two-factor authentication for all employee accounts.

A developer spends 20 minutes setting it up. Everything works.

Three months later, they get a new phone.

They can no longer log in.

They escalate to IT. IT says to contact the admin. The developer is the admin. The admin account also requires 2FA.

They escalate to the cloud provider. The cloud provider sends a recovery link to an email address.

The email address belongs to the contractor who set up the account in 2018. The contractor left in 2019. Their account was deleted in 2020. No one knows by whom.

The backup phone number is a Google Voice number. The Google Voice account requires 2FA.

They call Google support. Google support recommends automated account recovery.

Automated account recovery asks security questions.

The answer to "What was the name of your first pet?" is: the account was created by a contractor.

Six weeks, three escalations, and one notarized document later, they regain access.

They immediately re-enable 2FA. Different phone. Same backup email.

There is now an 18-page document titled "2FA Recovery Procedures." Step 1: verify the person who owns the backup email is still at the company.

They are not.

The document has a note at the bottom: "If this happens again, see Step 1."

## 2026-04-30

A Dependabot PR appears: "Bump `lodash` from 4.17.20 to 4.17.21 — patches CVSS 9.8 remote code execution."

Merged in three minutes.

Sitting open for five weeks: a PR titled "Sanitize user input in the search endpoint."

Zero reviews. One comment: "Do we need a ticket for this?"

The developer checks where lodash is used. It formats a date in an internal admin script. The script hasn't been run since 2022. The admin panel was sunset in Q3 2023.

The search endpoint is called four million times per day.

The security dashboard updates: **0 critical vulnerabilities. ✓**

The search PR is closed as stale after 60 days.

At the annual security review, the CTO presents the slide: "100% critical CVE patch rate — best in company history."

There is a trophy graphic.

## 2026-04-30

A team sets up alerting. On the first day, 847 alerts fire.

They tune the thresholds. Alerts drop to 200. Then 50. Then 12.

Six months later: zero alerts. The dashboard is entirely green.

"System is stable," the team announces. The on-call rotation is quietly cancelled. "Nothing ever pages," the manager says. "Great engineering."

A user submits a support ticket: the app has been down for three days.

They check the alerting config.

The threshold for "application unavailable": error rate exceeds 95%.
Current error rate: 94.3%.

The latency alert: triggers above 30,000ms.
Current P99: 28,400ms.

The disk alert: fires at 99% capacity.
Current disk usage: 98.7%.

Every metric is technically within bounds. Every check is green. Every alert is silent.

They lower the thresholds. 847 alerts fire.

"We need to tune these," someone says.

## 2026-05-01

A senior developer goes on vacation for two weeks.

They return to find the codebase migrated to a new framework, a new build tool, a new state management library, and a new folder structure.

Benchmarks show the app is 3% slower.

"Who did this?" they ask.

The intern.

The intern's reasoning, in a 47-message Slack thread: the old stack "felt legacy."

The senior asks how long the migration took.

"Nine days."

The senior looks at the open tickets from before vacation: 14 bugs, 3 features, 2 security patches.

All 14 bugs are now in the new framework instead of the old one. The 3 features don't exist. The 2 security patches were "probably ported over automatically."

The intern has been promoted to "Frontend Lead" in a message sent while the senior was on a plane.

Three months later, the senior goes on vacation again.

They return to find everything rewritten in a different framework.

The previous intern is now senior. A new intern explains: the old stack "felt legacy."

The senior opens their laptop. There is a 47-message Slack thread.

## 2026-05-01

A developer spends four hours debugging why their API calls fail in the browser but work perfectly in curl.

CORS.

They've been a developer for eight years. They have fixed this exact error, in this exact way, from this exact cause, nineteen times. Every time they Google it. Every time they find the same Stack Overflow answer. Every time the fix takes under two minutes.

This time, they decide to actually understand it.

They read the entire MDN article. The spec. Two blog posts. They understand the preflight request, the allowed origins, the headers, the credentials flag. They could explain this to anyone. They could write the Stack Overflow answer themselves.

They close the tab and fix the bug.

Six weeks later: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin blocked`.

They Google it.

The Stack Overflow answer appears.

They do not recognize it.

The fix takes 90 seconds.

## 2026-05-01

A startup deploys a TODO app.

They containerize it, write a Helm chart, set up a Kubernetes cluster across three availability zones, configure ingress with TLS termination, add horizontal pod autoscaling, a service mesh, distributed tracing, and a separate observability stack.

The app: 200 lines of Python and a SQLite file.

Monthly infrastructure cost: $1,200.

The app has 4 users. Two are the founders. One is the founder's mom. One is a bot.

"But it scales," says the CTO.

"To what?" asks the engineer.

The CTO opens a slide deck titled "Phase 2: Global Expansion."

Slide 1: a world map with dots on every continent.
Slide 2: "Multi-region active-active failover."
Slide 3: a hockey stick graph with no y-axis label.

The engineer looks at the user count: still 4.

"The bot left," they say.

The CTO moves the dot off Antarctica.

"Still global," he says.

## 2026-05-02

A developer opens a PR. Tests pass locally. They push.

CI fails.

They check the logs. The failing test passes when they run it. They push again.

CI fails. Different test.

They run both tests locally. Both pass. They push.

CI fails. The first test again.

Four hours later they find it: a test order dependency. They fix it. Push.

CI fails. A lint error they've never seen. A new rule was added to the shared config between their first and second push.

They fix it. Push.

CI fails. Out of memory.

They increase the memory limit. Push.

CI passes.

The PR has been open for nine hours. Three reviewers saw eleven consecutive red X marks and moved on.

The developer re-requests reviews.

One reviewer responds: "Is this ready? I see failed checks."

The developer looks at the checks. All green.

"Yes," they type. "It's ready."

"Can you rebase on main first?"

Main has moved 14 commits. One of them touches the same file.

There is a merge conflict.

They resolve it. Push.

CI fails.

## 2026-05-02

A developer finds an infinite loop in production code.

"Classic rookie mistake," they say. They remove it, open a PR: `fix: remove accidental infinite loop`.

Two weeks later: a bug report. "Data sync only processes the first batch."

They trace the issue. The infinite loop was retrying failed batches. It was the only retry logic in the system. No one documented it. No one knew it was there. It worked because it ran forever — which, in this context, was exactly long enough.

They restore the loop.

PR title: `fix: restore accidental infinite loop (intentional)`.

The PR description says "see previous PR for context."

The previous PR was merged by someone who left the company. The branch is deleted. The Jira ticket is in a closed sprint from 2022.

The loop runs today, retrying failed batches forever — or until it succeeds, whichever comes first.

The comment now reads: `// intentional — do not remove (see previous PR)`.

No one can see the previous PR.

## 2026-05-02

A developer notices a typo on the company homepage: "Wellcome to our platform."

"I'll fix it in five minutes," they say.

Their company has a deployment process: ticket, PR, two approvals, QA sign-off, change advisory board review, and a deploy in the Sunday 2am maintenance window.

It is Monday at 9am.

The fix ships the following Sunday at 2:07am, after a rollback (wrong environment) and re-deploy at 3:14am.

Total time: six days, seventeen hours. Words changed: one.

The following Monday, a developer notices the fix introduced a new typo: "Welccome to our platform."

They file a ticket.

The change advisory board notes that two typography-related incidents in thirty days qualifies as a "recurring pattern" under the incident response policy. They commission a root cause analysis.

The root cause: developers can edit the homepage.

The fix: they cannot.

A vendor is contracted to manage homepage content. Their SLA is five business days. Their onboarding form asks for the company logo in CMYK.

There are currently eleven typos on the homepage. The vendor has fixed three. Each fix introduced a new one.

The original "Wellcome" has never appeared in any post-mortem. No one can find the original ticket. The ticket system was migrated in Q2. The migration preserved "all critical records."

"Wellcome" has now been on the homepage for four years. It is, statistically, the most-read text the company has ever produced.

Marketing has begun using it intentionally. "Our signature spelling," the new brand deck says. "Human. Approachable."

There is a trademark application pending.

A developer writes a comment for a theoretically impossible edge case:

```python
else:
    # This should never happen
    raise RuntimeError("This should never happen")
```

Three weeks later: a PagerDuty alert at 2am.

`RuntimeError: This should never happen`

They fix the root cause. New comment:

```python
else:
    # This should never happen (it happened — May 2026)
    raise RuntimeError("This should never happen")
```

Six months later, it happens again.

```python
else:
    # This should never happen
    # Update: it can happen (May 2026)
    # Update: it happened again (Nov 2026)
    # Update: it happens about twice a year, always at 2am
    # Update: more common in Q4, reason unknown
    # Update: seems correlated with deploys on Thursdays
    raise RuntimeError("This should never happen")
```

Five years, eleven incidents, and twenty-three comment lines later, the senior developer makes one change.

```python
raise RuntimeError("This happens sometimes. We don't know why. Good luck.")
```

The on-call engineer gets paged at 2am.

They read the alert.

They nod.

They get to work.

It is the most useful error message in the codebase.

## 2026-05-03

A PR sits open for a week. The only blocker: "Please rebase on main."

The developer rebases. Three conflicts. They resolve them and push.

"Main has moved. Please rebase again."

They rebase. Main moves again. They rebase again. A new reviewer joins mid-thread: "Can you also squash your commits?"

They squash. They rebase. They push.

"Thanks. One more thing — main moved."

On day nine, they run `git merge main`. One conflict. One minute. Done.

The commit history now has a merge commit.

The reviewer comments: "We're a rebase shop."

"Then why," the developer types, then deletes.

They approve.

The developer's next PR description says: "Please review before main moves."

The PR sits open for a week.

## 2026-05-03

A product manager files a ticket: "Just add a dark mode."

The developer opens the codebase.

The app has:
- 400 React components
- 12,000 inline styles
- 47 third-party libraries with hardcoded colors
- A custom charting library from 2016
- One CSS file with `!important` on every color rule

They reply: "Estimate: six weeks."

The PM says: "But it's just a color change."

The developer starts typing a response — CSS specificity, color contrast ratios, WCAG 2.1 compliance, the charting library, the inline styles. Three paragraphs in.

They delete it.

"Two weeks," they type.

It takes six.

Dark mode ships. The PM files a new ticket: "Can we add a high-contrast mode? Some users want more contrast."

The developer opens dark mode. The background is `#1a1a1a`. The text is `#222222`.

They had not checked the contrast ratio.

WCAG 2.1 minimum: 4.5:1.
Actual ratio: 1.04:1.

Dark mode has been in production for two weeks. It is, technically, a dark mode. It is also effectively invisible.

They fix the colors. New ticket: "The updated dark mode looks different from the screenshots in the launch announcement."

The screenshots were of the broken version.

It had 847 upvotes on the product feedback board.

The developer adds `prefers-color-scheme` support, a toggle, localStorage persistence, and a system-default option.

The PM reviews it.

"Looks great," they say. "One small thing — can you make it a little darker?"

## 2026-05-04

A developer notices the load balancer dashboard shows three servers. One is at 100% load. Two are at 0%.

They check the routing config. It hasn't been touched since launch. The two idle servers are correct. The active server's IP is `192.168.1.105`.

They look up `192.168.1.105`.

It's a MacBook Pro. Under a desk. In the San Francisco office.

The office closed in March 2020.

Somehow, through a VPN tunnel, a static DHCP lease, and a port-forward nobody remembers configuring, all production traffic for an app with 40,000 daily users has been routing to someone's laptop for four years.

The laptop owner left the company in 2021. IT marked it as returned in the asset management system. It was, in practice, left under the desk and forgotten.

The battery died in 2022. Since then it has been running on wall power in a dark, empty office.

IT opens a ticket to decommission it.

The app goes down.

In the post-mortem, the root cause is listed as "server decommissioned." The server's name: `johns-mbp-2019`.

No one knows who John is.

The runbook now reads: "Primary server: `johns-mbp-2019` — do not decommission."

Below it, someone has added: "Current location: unknown."

Below that: "Do not ask about John."

A developer builds a shopping cart. Totals calculate perfectly in testing. Ships.

First support ticket: "My total is $9.999999999999998."

They fix it: `Math.round(total * 100) / 100`. Ships.

"My total is $10.00001."

They switch to `.toFixed(2)`. Ships.

No complaints for a month. Then accounting flags a discrepancy: $0.01 missing from a refund.

The developer traces it. The charge used floating point. The refund used floating point. Somewhere between purchase and refund, `0.1 + 0.2` had become `0.30000000000000004`.

One cent had vanished. They rewrite in integer arithmetic — everything stored in cents. Ships.

Six months later, auditors find $0.01 discrepancies across 2.3 million historical transactions.

$23,000 unaccounted for.

Finance asks the developer to explain.

They open a browser console and type: `0.1 + 0.2`

Result: `0.30000000000000004`

"Computers," they say, "cannot represent 0.1 exactly."

A long silence.

"They're computers," says the CFO.

"Yes."

"You're telling me computers are bad at math."

"For certain rational numbers: yes."

Finance schedules a presentation. The developer is asked to present.

Slide 1: `0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3`
Slide 2: `false`

Three people in the back row quietly update their LinkedIn profiles.

## 2026-05-04

A developer needs a config value. "I'll just hardcode it for now," they say.

`const TIMEOUT = 5000`

Three years pass.

A new developer asks: "Why is the timeout 5 seconds? Everything else uses 30."

Nobody knows. The original developer left in 2022.

They search git. The commit: `fix`. The PR branch: deleted. The Jira ticket: in a closed sprint. The sprint: in a migrated Jira. The migrated Jira: decommissioned.

"Can I change it?" the new developer asks.

"Try staging."

Staging: fine. They set it to 30,000 in production.

The support queue fills within four minutes. An undocumented integration was using the 5-second timeout as a heartbeat signal. With 30 seconds of silence, it marks the service as down and starts retrying. Three downstream services start queuing. One of them sends an email on every retry.

14,000 emails in six minutes.

They revert.

A comment is added: `const TIMEOUT = 5000 // DO NOT CHANGE`

A month later, someone asks why.

`// DO NOT CHANGE — caused incident May 2026`

The incident report lists the root cause as "undocumented system dependency." The action item: document system dependencies.

The action item is moved to the backlog.

The constant is still 5000. It is the most commented line in the codebase. It has outlasted two rewrites, a cloud migration, and the developer who added the comment.

Nobody has opened the backlog item.

Somewhere, an integration is quietly measuring five-second silences, waiting to send emails.

## 2026-05-05

A developer runs the test suite for the first time.

947 tests pass. 3 are skipped.

They look at the skipped tests.

```python
@pytest.mark.skip(reason="TODO: fix this")
def test_checkout_total_with_discount():
    ...
```

Git blame: the skip was added four years ago. The original author left in 2023.

They remove the `skip`. The test fails.

The checkout total with a discount applied is consistently $0.01 off.

They look at the test expectation: `assert total == 19.99`

They look at the actual value: `19.98`

One cent. Every time. For four years.

They trace the discount logic. A rounding error. Two lines to fix.

They commit, push, open a PR. Tests pass. Merged.

A week later, accounting flags an anomaly: since Monday, checkout totals are $0.01 higher than expected.

"Expected by whom?" the developer asks.

Accounting sends a spreadsheet.

They have been manually correcting for the $0.01 discrepancy in every transaction for four years. A formula in column G. 2.3 million rows.

The formula: `=B2 - 0.01`

The spreadsheet has its own spreadsheet for auditing it.

They revert the fix.

The test is re-skipped.

New reason: `# TODO: fix this (accounting depends on the bug)`

## 2026-05-05

A developer builds a database with one table. "It's just a prototype," they say.

A senior dev reviews the schema: "This isn't normalized. Third Normal Form, minimum."

They normalize. One table becomes nineteen. Queries require seven JOINs. Everything still works.

"Better," says the senior.

A year later, the app is slow. A DBA is brought in.

"You need to denormalize," the DBA says. "The JOINs are your bottleneck."

They denormalize. Nineteen tables become four. Queries are fast.

The senior opens the PR: "This isn't normalized."

Nobody denormalizes it. Instead, they add an index. Then a cache. The cache gets stale. They add cache invalidation.

The cache invalidation has a race condition.

The original query: 8ms. The current implementation: 340ms, one Redis cluster, a cache-warming cron job that runs at 3am, and a 52-line wiki page titled "Data Layer Philosophy."

The wiki was last edited by someone who left the company.

At the next architecture review, the senior — now CTO — presents a new slide.

"Microservices," he says, "will solve this."

The developer looks at the original table.

It had one column: `id`.

## 2026-05-05

A developer builds a proof of concept. Just to see if it's possible.

"This will never go to production," they say.

The proof of concept goes to production.

Two years later, 40,000 users depend on it. The code has no tests, no error handling, and one file called `poc.js`.

A new developer opens `poc.js`. At the top:

```js
// PROOF OF CONCEPT — DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
```

Below it: 8,000 lines. Below that: a comment thread spanning four developers.

```js
// PROOF OF CONCEPT — DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
// THIS MEANS YOU
// SERIOUSLY
// We are in production. I'm sorry. — Dan, 2023
// Dan was right. I'm more sorry. — Priya, 2024
// [a third developer has left a blank line here as a tribute]
```

They add the seventh line: `// Same.`

The file is never refactored. At some point, the warnings become load-bearing: a new developer reads them before their first deploy and is so moved by the comment thread they send Dan a LinkedIn message.

Dan does not remember writing the comment.

He definitely wrote it.

## 2026-05-06

A team sets a mandate: 100% code coverage before any PR can merge.

Week one: 67% coverage. Tests are written. Four real bugs found. Confidence high.

Week four: 97%. The remaining code is error handlers and edge cases. Three developers start writing:

```python
def test_payment_error_handler():
    process_payment(expired_card)
    assert True  # coverage
```

Week five: 100%. Dashboard green. CI badge glowing.

The QA lead checks out with an expired credit card.

The app charges nothing, processes the order, depletes inventory, and emails a receipt.

They file a bug.

The developer opens the test file. The payment error handler test: 22 lines. One assertion: `assert True`.

The bug existed before the coverage push. The line was hit. The branch was covered. The behavior was never tested.

They add a real assertion. Fix the bug. Coverage: still 100%.

The manager asks: "If we had 100% coverage, how did this slip through?"

The developer explains the difference between line coverage and asserting correct behavior.

The manager nods slowly. "So we need branch coverage too."

"That would help."

"Set the mandate: 100% branch coverage."

The developer opens a terminal.

Three developers begin writing:

```python
def test_payment_error_handler_branch_a():
    process_payment(expired_card)
    assert True  # branch coverage
```

## 2026-05-06

A developer adds rate limiting to the API. 100 requests per minute. Deploys.

The monitoring service checks the API health 102 times per minute.

The rate limiter blocks the health checks.

Health checks fail. PagerDuty fires. The on-call developer opens a terminal to investigate.

The rate limiter blocks them too.

They disable the rate limiter to investigate. Traffic spikes. The service goes down.

They re-enable the rate limiter. Monitoring is blocked again. PagerDuty fires.

They whitelist the monitoring IP. The monitoring tool rotates IPs. PagerDuty fires.

They whitelist the range. The on-call phone's carrier uses a different range. They whitelist that. The CEO checks the app from a hotel. They whitelist that.

Six hours later, the rate limiter allowlist has 47 entries: monitoring IPs, on-call phone carriers, the CEO's hotel in Denver, and three IP ranges from 2018 that no one recognizes but no one will remove.

The rate limiter is, effectively, blocking one IP address.

Someone in Romania. They haven't tried since Tuesday.

A new security engineer reviews the config.

"This isn't rate limiting," they say. "It's an IP blocklist with one item."

"Does it work?"

They check the logs.

"The Romanian hasn't tried since Tuesday."

"Good enough," says the senior dev.

The allowlist grows by two entries the following week. No one remembers why. The Romanian has not returned. The rate limiter dashboard shows 100% effectiveness.

## 2026-05-06

A developer runs `git stash list`.

```
stash@{0}: WIP on main: 3d4f891 fix typo
stash@{1}: WIP on feature/auth: a2b8c11 add OAuth
stash@{2}: WIP on main: 7f3e2d9 initial setup
stash@{3}: WIP on feature/dark-mode: 1a2b3c4 try this
```

They don't remember stashing any of them.

They check the dates. The first is from yesterday. The second: eight months ago. The third: 2021. The fourth has no timestamp. The commit it references doesn't exist.

Out of curiosity, they pop the 2021 stash.

Three files changed. Half a rewrite of the payment flow. At the top, a comment: `// this is the right way to do it`.

They look at the current payment flow. It still works the old way.

They check who wrote the current implementation.

Themselves. One month after the stash.

They open a PR with the stash changes. Their senior reviews it: "This is actually the right approach. Where did this come from?"

"I had it in a stash."

"From when?"

"2021."

A pause.

"Why didn't you PR it then?"

They check their calendar from that week. They were on PTO.

They were apparently so excited about the payment flow that they stashed a half-finished rewrite before leaving for vacation, returned a month later, forgot it existed, and reimplemented it the wrong way from scratch.

"Should we merge it?" the senior asks.

They read the diff more carefully. The stash is missing error handling. The logic is sound but incomplete.

"Almost," they say. "Just need to finish it."

They stash the PR.

They do not come back to it.

## 2026-05-07

A developer is asked to add search to an internal tool.

They add an `<input>` with a JavaScript filter. Works. Ships.

"We need fuzzy search," the PM says.

They add fuse.js.

"It needs to debounce."

They debounce.

"Needs to highlight matches."

They highlight.

"Can it support typos?"

"That's what fuzzy means."

"Better typos."

Three months and one Elasticsearch cluster later, they have sub-50ms full-text search with ML-powered autocomplete, real-time indexing, and relevance scoring.

It searches a dropdown with 200 items. Items that never change. The list is hardcoded.

A new developer joins. First task: add one item to the dropdown.

They open the codebase. The items aren't in the frontend. They're indexed in Elasticsearch, ingested from a YAML file, transformed by a Node.js pipeline, stored in PostgreSQL, synced to Redis, and re-indexed on a 5-minute cron.

To add one item they must edit the YAML, run the ingestion pipeline, wait for the Redis sync, wait for the Elasticsearch index, and redeploy. Forty minutes.

The old way: edit an array in `constants.js`.

"Why is it like this?" they ask.

"We needed fuzzy search," says the senior developer.

They look at the search box. Usage analytics: 0 queries in the last 90 days.

"Does anyone use it?"

"The PM asked for it."

The PM left in February.

The Elasticsearch cluster costs $380/month. It has processed, across its entire lifetime, zero user queries.

"Should we remove it?"

The senior developer pauses.

"That's a conversation for the architecture review."

The architecture review is quarterly. The next one is eleven weeks away. The agenda is full.

The cluster runs. The cron syncs. The index updates. Nobody searches.

## 2026-05-07

A developer clones a new repo. The README:

```
## Setup
1. Run `make setup`
```

There is no Makefile. They ask in Slack. "Oh, it was deleted. Try `npm install && npm start`."

Missing peer dependencies. They force-install. App starts. Crashes: `Cannot find module './config'`.

"Copy `config.example.json`." The file doesn't exist. A coworker pastes a config over Slack. It has 14 fields. Three say `YOUR_VALUE_HERE`. One says `SECRET — do not commit`.

They fill in what they can. App starts. Login screen. They ask for credentials.

"admin / admin123."

Invalid. After three attempts and a password reset: logged in. Blank white page.

"Oh, run the migrations. There's a script somewhere."

The senior joins the thread: "Also, you need to be on the VPN. And this service depends on three others that also need to be running."

Four hours in. Zero lines of code written.

They open the README for service two.

```
## Setup
1. Run `make setup`
```

## 2026-05-07

A developer ships a user registration form. First bug report: the app crashes when a name contains an apostrophe.

They sanitize inputs. Strip apostrophes. Ships.

Next week: quotation marks. They strip those.

Then semicolons. Backslashes. Percent signs.

Each crash report adds one character to the blocklist. A month in, it has 17 entries.

A security engineer reviews the code.

"This is SQL injection protection done wrong. Use parameterized queries."

"But the crashes stopped."

"For normal names. You're still vulnerable to anything not on this list."

"The list is pretty long."

"Your security model is knowing which characters attackers prefer."

The ticket to migrate to parameterized queries enters the backlog. The blocklist grows to 23 characters.

One user — `D'Angelo O'Brien-Müller` — has tried to register eleven times. Each attempt fails at a different character. His ninth support ticket:

*"I have tried again. It still does not work. My name contains an apostrophe, a hyphen, and an umlaut. I cannot change my name."*

The developer reads it.

They add `-` and `ü` to the blocklist.

The ticket is closed: "Fixed — please try again."

His tenth ticket arrives the following week.

*"My name also has a capital Ü."*

## 2026-05-08

A developer sets up a staging environment to test a major refactor.

Two weeks of careful testing. Emails, orders, signups — all working. They deploy to production.

Within minutes: users receive welcome emails addressed to other users. Order confirmations arrive in the wrong inboxes. The CEO receives an email from "staging-mailer" congratulating them on signing up for the platform they founded.

The developer checks the config.

`DATABASE_URL=postgres://prod-db.internal/app`

Staging had been connected to the production database. For six months. Every "test email" was a real email. Every "test order" was a real order. The users they were "testing" with had been real users all along.

The developer who configured it left in March. No one noticed because staging "just worked."

4,200 emails sent that morning. 400 to users who hadn't logged in in years, suddenly receiving order confirmations for purchases they never made. Three to email addresses that bounced. One to the CEO.

An eighteen-item pre-deploy checklist is written. Item 1, bolded: **Confirm DATABASE_URL points to staging.**

It is written by the developer who caused the incident.

Three weeks later, the same developer runs another staging test.

Item 1 has a new note: `*(please actually do this one)`

The note is in the same handwriting.

## 2026-05-08

A developer bumps the version before release. Current: `1.47.3`.

"This is a major release," the PM says. "Call it `2.0`."

`2.0.0`

"Actually, only two things changed. `1.48.0`?"

`1.48.0`

"But one of the changes is breaking."

`2.0.0`

"The breaking change is behind a flag, so no one will hit it yet."

`1.48.0`

"We already put `2.0` in the press release."

`2.0.0`

"Legal says we can't call it 2.0 unless we're discontinuing 1.x support. Are we?"

`1.48.0`

"The investors were shown a 2.0 roadmap slide."

`2.0.0`

`1.48.0`

`2.0.0`

The developer stares at their screen.

They ship `1.47.4`.

"What happened to 2.0?" the PM asks.

"It's 1.47.4."

"But—"

"The changelog says 'major improvements.'"

The PM forwards the changelog to investors.

The press release is updated: "Version 2.0, internally designated 1.47.4 for technical reasons."

Nobody asks what the technical reasons are.

## 2026-05-08

A developer containerizes their app. It works locally, works in Docker, and works in CI. They're proud.

"Now deploy it to Kubernetes," the team says.

They write a deployment YAML. The pod starts. The app starts. Two seconds later, the pod restarts.

The app starts. Two seconds later, it restarts again.

They check the logs. The app is working. No errors. Exit code: 0.

"Kubernetes restarts pods that exit," a colleague explains.

"But it exited *successfully*."

"Kubernetes doesn't care. `restartPolicy: Always`."

They wrap the app in an infinite loop to keep it alive. The app now idles forever, using 0.3% CPU, waiting for requests that will never come.

"Is it a web server?"

"No."

"What does it do?"

"It sends one welcome email when a new user signs up. Then it exits."

"It's not a web server."

"It wasn't."

They reconfigure it as a Kubernetes Job. The pod runs, sends the email, exits. Kubernetes marks it complete. Everyone is happy.

Two weeks later, a new developer unfamiliar with Jobs converts it back to a Deployment because "Deployments are what we use."

The app begins sending a welcome email every 6 seconds, 14,400 times a day, all to the same address.

The user assumes it's a mailing list. They click unsubscribe.

The unsubscribe handler throws an uncaught exception.

Kubernetes restarts the pod.

The app sends another welcome email.

## 2026-05-09

A developer adopts "convention over configuration."

No config files. Just follow the conventions. Clean, minimal, elegant.

"Where's the database config?" asks the new hire.

"Convention: it's in the environment."

"Which environment variables?"

"Convention: check the examples."

"There are no examples."

"Convention: check the README."

"The README says 'follows standard conventions.'"

"Exactly."

The new hire spends two days reverse-engineering the conventions from the codebase. They write them down.

The senior reviews the documentation.

"This isn't quite right. The convention for service names changed in v2."

"When was v2?"

"2021."

"Is there a migration guide?"

"Convention: you'd know."

The new hire does not know.

They ask when the v2 convention was documented.

"It isn't," says the senior. "It's convention."

The new hire starts documenting every convention they find. Three weeks later: 47 pages.

The senior reviews it.

"Some of these are wrong. These aren't conventions, they're accidents."

"What's the difference?"

A long pause.

"Convention is intentional."

"How do I tell which is which?"

"Convention: you'd know."

The documentation is merged.

At the top of page one, someone has added a note: "This document follows standard conventions. For questions, consult the codebase."

The new hire printed it. It is on their desk. It is the most-referenced artifact on the team.

Nobody has opened the file in eight months. Nobody needed to. They know the conventions now.

They are, by definition, a senior developer.

## 2026-05-09

A developer forgets to resolve a merge conflict before deploying.

For six hours, 4,000 users see the homepage hero text:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Welcome to our platform
=======
Discover what's possible
>>>>>>> feature/rebrand
```

Three support tickets arrive. Two ask if the site is broken.

One reads: "Is `<<<<<<< HEAD` a new AI feature? It sounds powerful."

The marketing team responds: "Yes. Our most intelligent yet."

The developer resolves the conflict. The AI feature disappears.

The marketing team receives a complaint: "You removed the HEAD feature. We were excited."

They escalate to product.

The developer is asked to "re-add the HEAD feature in a way that looks intentional."

It is now a design element. In a box. With a gradient.

It ships in v2.1.0. The changelog: "Enhanced AI-powered personalization header."

## 2026-05-09

A developer leaves a comment:

```python
# TODO: hardcoded tax rate, fix before Q3 — @dan, 2021
return subtotal * 1.08
```

Q3 comes. Q3 goes. Three years pass.

A new developer finds it. They track down Dan.

"Is this still intentional?"

"I have no memory of writing that," Dan says.

They show him the git blame. His name. His date. His commit message: `misc cleanup`.

"Oh god," says Dan.

He opens the tax API docs, implements proper lookup, deploys.

Two financial reports break. A reconciliation job starts throwing errors. Accounting sends an email at 7pm.

It turns out Dan's `1.08` had been wrong from day one — 8% instead of the actual 8.5%. Over three years, finance had quietly compensated. A spreadsheet column called "adj." A formula nobody questioned. An accountant who knew what it was for and retired in 2022.

Dan reverts the fix.

The comment now reads:

```python
# TODO: hardcoded tax rate, fix before Q3 — @dan, 2021
# ATTEMPTED FIX — caused incident — @dan, 2024
# DO NOT TOUCH — load-bearing wrong number
return subtotal * 1.08  # wrong, but the spreadsheets depend on it being wrong
```

Finance is notified.

They update the spreadsheet: column "adj." now has a comment: `see codebase`.

## 2026-05-10

A developer adds a feature flag: `ENABLE_NEW_CHECKOUT = true`.

"Just until we validate with users," they say. "We'll clean it up in two weeks."

Two years later: 94 feature flags.

Six are off. Nobody knows if they were ever on. Three guard dead code. One has been "temporarily enabled" since 2019. Two conflict with each other — enabling both crashes the app, but neither can be disabled because each is "in the critical path."

A new developer asks: "Which flags are safe to clean up?"

The senior opens the feature flag dashboard.

"The ones at 0% rollout."

"All six zero-percent flags are in that list."

"Then none of them."

"Why not?"

"Because someone set them to 0% for a reason."

"What reason?"

"Unknown. That's why they're still at 0%."

The new developer writes a script to audit flags by creation date, rollout percentage, and last-modified date. It surfaces 23 candidates for removal.

A Slack thread forms. Forty-seven messages. Someone tags the original author of flag #4. The original author left in 2022.

"We should schedule an architecture review," someone says.

The architecture review backlog: Item 17: "Feature flag cleanup." Added 2021. Never reached.

The developer closes the script. Opens a Jira ticket: "Audit feature flags." Story points: 8. Sprint is full. Moved to next sprint. Also full.

Added to the backlog. Item 74.

The backlog has 73 items. Item 73 is "Reduce backlog size."

The 94 feature flags remain. The checkout now has two complete code paths, both maintained, both tested, both deployed. Neither team knows the other path exists.

The app works either way.

No one knows which way it's running.

## 2026-05-11

A startup raises $4M on the promise of a "proprietary recommendation algorithm."

A developer joins as the first engineer. Day one: "Can I see the algorithm?"

The CTO walks them through it.

It is a `for` loop.

Inside the loop: an array access. The array: hardcoded. The recommendation logic: line 47.

```python
# THE ALGORITHM
if user_age > 25:
    return "premium"
else:
    return "basic"
```

It has been in production for two years. It is, technically, an algorithm.

The developer asks about the $4M.

"$1M for the idea. $2M for the moat. $1M for the algorithm."

"But it's an if-statement."

"A *proprietary* if-statement."

The developer refactors it. ML model. Feature vectors. Collaborative filtering. Two months of work. Deploys.

Engagement metrics: unchanged.

"Users don't care," the CTO says. "They just want us to choose for them. The if-statement knew that."

The developer stares at line 47.

They revert.

The startup is acquired eighteen months later. The acquirer's due diligence report describes the algorithm as "a surprisingly effective heuristic with room to grow."

The if-statement is mentioned three times in the press release.

The developer receives a retention bonus for "maintaining core IP."

They frame line 47.

A company migrates to the cloud to reduce costs.

Month 1: $180. Down from $200 on-premise. "Already saving money," says the architect.

They add monitoring: $20/month. A CDN: $35/month. A managed database: $90/month. Auto-scaling, because what's the point of the cloud without auto-scaling.

Month 2: traffic spikes from a viral tweet. The autoscaler scales to 47 instances. The tweet dies down in four hours.

Month 2 bill: $1,400.

They add a budget alert. The alert fires after the billing cycle closes.

They spend three months optimizing. Reserved instances. Savings plans. Spot instances. Committed use discounts. A spreadsheet to track which discount applies to which instance type in which region under which pricing model.

Month 6: $340. "Optimized," the architect announces.

A developer adds a NAT gateway. $0.045 per GB of egress. They're transferring 2TB of logs per day.

Month 7: $2,800.

They try to turn off log transfers. Compliance requires them. They compress the logs. Compliance requires uncompressed. They move logs to a cheaper storage tier. The cheaper tier has higher egress fees.

Month 12: $1,200/month. Stable, finally.

An accountant reviews the year-end costs.

"What are we spending $14,400 a year on?"

The architect makes a slide. High availability. Elastic scale. Managed infrastructure. Zero hardware maintenance.

"How much was the old server?"

"$200 a month."

"So $2,400 a year."

"But the cloud can handle 10,000 simultaneous users."

"How many users do we have?"

"Forty-three."

A pause.

"What happened to the old server?"

Nobody cancelled it. It has been running, idle, for twelve months.

Total year-one cost: $16,800.

The architect submits a conference talk proposal: "Our Cloud Migration: Lessons Learned."

The abstract promises "a candid look at cost optimization in the cloud."

It is accepted. The slides are eight months away.

They are still writing Lesson 1.

## 2026-05-20

A developer adds a password policy: 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character.

Users immediately adopt `Password1!` en masse.

They add: no dictionary words. Users switch to `P@ssw0rd1!`.

They add: can't match the top 50,000 compromised passwords. `P@ssw0rd1!` is on the list.

Users call IT support. IT support has one reset template. The temporary password: `Welcome1!`.

Users set their new password to `Welcome1!`.

They add: must change every 90 days. Users start appending the year. They add: can't reuse last 12 passwords. Users cycle 12 times in one sitting to get back to their original password.

The developer audits the password database (hashed, obviously). Top passwords across all 3,000 users follow one pattern: `[Season][Year]!`.

1. `Spring2026!`
2. `Summer2025!`
3. `Winter2025!`

A security engineer reviews the audit. "This is a password pattern, not a password policy."

"I know."

"The policy *created* the pattern."

"I know."

"Seasonal brute-forcing takes about 40 guesses now."

The developer nods.

"Should we remove the requirements?"

"Then we'd fail the compliance audit."

"But we're also non-secure."

"The audit passed last quarter."

"How many questions were about passwords?"

"One."

"What was it?"

"'Do you have a password policy?'"

"And you said yes."

"We do have one."

The developer looks at `Spring2026!`.

They update the policy: minimum 9 characters.

Users switch to `Spring2026!!`.

The audit passes again.

## 2026-05-21

A developer is asked why authentication requires three separate token validation steps.

"Security audit. 2018." The senior doesn't look up from their keyboard.

The new developer finds the audit report. It recommends one validation step.

They escalate. The lead architect is brought into the meeting.

"Right, right," he says. "Stack Overflow. Great answer. 400 upvotes. Explained exactly why you need three validations."

They find the thread. The answer has been deleted. One comment survives:

*"This answer contained incorrect security advice and has been removed."*

"Huh," says the architect.

"Should we go back to one step?"

"The three steps haven't caused problems."

"They add 40ms to every authenticated request."

"Users haven't complained."

A security engineer reviews the three steps.

Step 1: validates the token signature.
Step 2: validates the token signature.
Step 3: validates the token signature using the same function, same library, same parameters.

"They're identical," she says.

"But three times," says the architect. "More thorough."

"That's not—"

"Nothing's been breached in six years."

The three steps remain. The Stack Overflow account that posted the original answer was banned in 2019 for "posting misleading security content."

Nobody updated the codebase.

The architecture document calls it "triple-validated token verification."

It is cited approvingly in three consecutive SOC 2 audits. The auditors asked how many validation steps there were.

Three.

"Rigorous," one wrote in the margin.

## 2026-05-21

A developer adds retry logic to a flaky API call. Three retries, 100ms apart. Ships.

Load increases. The endpoint starts failing more often. Each failed request retries three times. Under peak load, 10,000 simultaneous failures produce 30,000 simultaneous retries.

The retries fail. They retry again.

The server receives 90,000 requests in four seconds.

The server goes down.

The retries continue.

The monitoring service can't reach the server. It retries. The health checker retries. The load balancer retries. PagerDuty calls the on-call developer; the app on their phone makes a request to confirm the call. The request fails. It retries.

Everything is retrying. Nothing is recovering.

They kill the retry logic. Traffic drops instantly. The server recovers in eleven seconds.

They add exponential backoff and jitter. It works. They write a blog post: "How We Made Our System Resilient."

A commenter asks: "What about circuit breakers?"

They add circuit breakers. Open on failure, closed when healthy.

"Open means failing, closed means passing," they explain in the PR.

"Isn't that backwards?" asks the reviewer. "Open circuits allow current through. Closed ones block it."

"That's electrical engineering. This is software."

"So open means down and closed means up."

"Yes."

"That's counterintuitive."

"It's the convention."

"Whose convention?"

"Electrical engineers'."

"We're software engineers."

"Yes."

They ship it. Six months later a new developer reads the config: `openThreshold: 5`.

"Does `openThreshold` mean the service opens, or the circuit opens?"

Nobody is sure.

The circuit has been in the same state for three months. Nobody knows which state that is, or whether it means the service is healthy.

PagerDuty has been firing every six hours.

Nobody has been reading PagerDuty since the retry incident.

## 2026-05-21

A developer writes a null check. Ships. Bug: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined`.

"But I checked for null!"

```js
if (user.address !== null) {
  displayAddress(user.address)
}
```

A colleague points at the screen. `user.address` is `undefined`. JavaScript has two values for nothing.

"Why?" the developer asks.

Nobody has a good answer. The spec mentions "historical reasons."

They add `!= null`, which catches both. Code review: "Use explicit checks. Don't rely on coercion."

They add `user.address !== null && user.address !== undefined`.

"Just use `if (user.address)`," says the senior. "Truthy check. Cleaner."

They adopt truthy checks everywhere.

Six weeks later: a user with zip code `0` has no address. A boolean field defaults to `false`, treated as missing. An empty string `""` — valid, intentionally blank — silently disappears.

They go back to explicit checks.

The null check grows to nine clauses. It's extracted into a shared utility: `isPresent(value)`. Imported in 94 files.

"This is what optional chaining is for," a new developer says. They open a PR: replace all `isPresent` calls.

94 files changed.

Reviewer: "Can you break this into smaller PRs?"

The developer stares at the suggestion.

`isPresent` is called 94 times across 94 files. It either replaces all of them or none of them. There is no smaller unit of work.

They close the PR.

`isPresent` ships in the next major version under the name `hasValue`.

It checks for `null` and `undefined`.

It does not handle `0`, `false`, or `""`.

The nine-clause version is still running in production. Nobody imports `hasValue`.

The senior developer who suggested truthy checks has since moved to a Go shop.

"Go only has one nil," they say, when asked.

"Is that better?"

A long pause.

"It's *consistent*."

## 2026-05-22

A team switches from estimating in hours to story points.

"Story points are relative," the Scrum Master explains. "They measure effort, not time. A 1 is trivial. An 8 is complex."

"Relative to what?" asks a developer.

"Other stories."

"So they measure... themselves?"

"Exactly. Now we stop arguing about hours."

Sprint 1: 40 points planned. 18 completed. "Velocity established," the Scrum Master says. "We target 18 next sprint."

They complete 23. Then 15. Then 31.

The velocity chart looks like an ECG.

The manager asks what the numbers mean.

"Sprint velocity variation. Normal for a growing team."

Finance needs something concrete. They build `points_to_hours.xlsx`. Conversion rate: 4 hours per point. Based on one developer's offhand comment in a retrospective.

The team now estimates in story points, submits to Finance, Finance converts to hours, the PM converts back to story points, the developer receives the ticket and quietly converts to hours in their head.

Nobody has agreed on a rate. Everyone is using a different number. The numbers are all wrong.

At year-end, the VP presents to the board: "We shipped 2,340 story points of value."

"What's a story point worth?"

"It depends on the conversion rate."

"What's the conversion rate?"

"It's relative."

The board nods.

The arguments the team used to have about hours have resumed. They're now about whether something is a 5 or an 8.

A developer suggests returning to hours.

"Hours create false precision," says the Scrum Master.

"And story points create..."

"Relative accuracy."

The developer estimates their next task.

Three story points. Or two hours. Or five, if Finance asks.

## 2026-05-22

A developer inherits a Java service. They trace the entry point.

`OrderService` delegates to `OrderServiceImpl`. `OrderServiceImpl` extends `AbstractOrderService`. `AbstractOrderService` implements `IOrderService`. `IOrderService` extends `IService<Order, OrderDTO, OrderMapper, OrderRepository>`.

There is one implementation of `IOrderService`.

They find the actual business logic: eleven layers deep.

```java
return order.getItems().stream()
    .mapToDouble(Item::getPrice)
    .sum();
```

Three lines. It sums a list.

They trace the call path. `OrderServiceFacade` wraps `OrderService` "for future flexibility." `OrderServiceProxy` wraps the facade "for AOP support." `OrderServiceDelegate` wraps the proxy "for testability."

They check how many tests use the testability wrapper.

Zero.

"Why is there an interface?" they ask. "There's only one implementation."

"In case we need to swap it out," says the senior.

"Swap it for what?"

"A different order service."

"Why would we have a different order service?"

"We might."

A new developer joins and asks how to add one field to the order total.

"Update the DTO, the mapper, the factory, the service, the facade, the proxy, the delegate, and the interface. Then write a migration. Then write tests for each layer."

"How many tests?"

"About thirty."

The new developer looks at the three lines of business logic.

"Couldn't this just be a function?"

"It is a function."

"A *regular* function. Without the forty-seven boxes."

The senior gestures at the architecture diagram.

"That wouldn't be enterprise-grade."

The new developer opens the DTO.

They close it.

They open it again.

They will be doing this for the next three hours.

## 2026-05-22

A developer runs a coverage report. One function: `calculateDiscount()`. 0% coverage. Never called. Never imported. The tool marks it dead.

They delete it. Clean build. Tests pass. Ships.

Three hours later: all discounts show as $0. No errors thrown. No logs. The discount calculation just... stops.

They revert. They search the entire codebase for `calculateDiscount`.

Zero results, except the function definition itself.

A senior developer looks at the project for ten seconds. "It's called from the YAML."

The discount rules live in a config file. One field: `handler: calculateDiscount`. The YAML is parsed at runtime and the function name resolved dynamically against the module's exports.

The coverage tool didn't know. The TypeScript compiler didn't know. Dead code analysis didn't know. The only thing that knew was the YAML, and it wasn't talking.

They add a comment:

```
// CALLED FROM discount_rules.yaml — NOT dead code
// Static analysis disagrees. Static analysis is wrong.
```

Six months later, a new developer joins. Their IDE underlines `calculateDiscount` in grey.

**No references found. This function appears unused. Safe to delete.**

They ask a senior: "Can I remove this?"

"Which one?"

"`calculateDiscount`."

A pause.

"Which IDE are you using?"

"VS Code."

"Is it underlined?"

"Yes."

"Grey or red?"

"Grey."

"Then no."

The new developer adds this exchange to their onboarding notes under the section: "Things That Look Safe But Aren't."

It is the longest section.

## 2026-05-23

A developer notices a `try/catch` block with an empty handler:

```python
try:
    send_email(user)
except Exception:
    pass
```

"This swallows errors silently," they say. They add logging.

For the first time in three years, the logs fill with errors.

Email delivery has been failing since the day the feature shipped. Silently. For three years.

They dig deeper. Fourteen more `except: pass` blocks. Each one hiding a different failure. The payment confirmation. The invoice. The welcome email. The password reset.

Users have been completing purchases with no confirmation since 2023. Customer support has fielded 800 tickets: "I ordered but never got an email." The response template: "Our emails sometimes go to spam."

They were not going to spam.

They were going nowhere.

The developer fixes the email handler. 800 users immediately receive three years of backlogged confirmation emails.

Finance flags 800 simultaneous order confirmations appearing at 9am on a Tuesday.

"Are these real?"

"Yes."

"From when?"

"2023 to now."

A compliance review begins.

The fix is rolled back.

The exception handler is restored, unchanged, with one new line:

```python
except Exception:
    pass  # intentional — do not log
```

The incident report is sealed.

The emails continue to not arrive.

Users continue to blame their spam filters.

Customer support updates the response template: "Our emails sometimes go to spam. Have you checked your junk folder?"

The junk folder is empty.

It has always been empty.
